## About ##
Started developing websites in 2008 (at Atlant-Telecom). But in 2010 went into a different field. I became a journalist on a large website (Onliner.by). In 2021 began to study Frontend. Already familiar with the basics JavaScript. I plan to find a job in this area by the summer of 2022. The reason for the change of activity is moving to another country. Now I live in Poland.  
I study a lot - 3 - 6 hours a day. Every day. Since 2013 I have been working on my own project - website R24.by. I made it from scratch and now it is my main source of income. I have experience in communicating with developers during the development of web applications.

## Work and learning experience ##
Two years of work in the web studio Atlant-Telecom. Courses JavaScript and React/Redux.  
#### English: pre-intermediate. #### 

## Code Example ## 

<pre> function timer (curTime = +localStorage.getItem('dataNow')) {  
    myTime = setInterval(() => {  
        learningTime = Math.floor((Date.now() - curTime) / 1000) + oldTime;  
        localStorage.setItem('today', learningTime);  
        updTodayTime(learningTime);  
    }, 1000);  
} // calculate my learning time</pre>

(this is part of my program - a timer on which I count the hours of learning JS. Here I use localStorage to make the program work even if I close the browser)
